What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A regular directory turns into a GIT repository which here after can track changes
on file basis and maintain a history of changes when commits are made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area seems to be an intermediate spot b/w the working directory (no history) and 
repository. It offers an ability to select files for a particular commit out of multiple 
files open in the directory
