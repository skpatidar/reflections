What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A regular directory turns into a GIT repository which here after can track changes
on file basis and maintain a history of changes when commits are made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area seems to be an intermediate spot b/w the working directory (no history) and 
repository. It offers an ability to select files for a particular commit out of multiple 
files open in the directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

With staging area I can move all the files that are changed towards the logical change 
into the staging area, then do a git diff staged to see what changes I am commiting.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?

For trying out new features/experiements, for ramping up new developers on a large project.
For changes that are massive and atomic, we can branch out and merge back in when the whole
thing works
