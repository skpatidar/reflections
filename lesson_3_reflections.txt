When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Open source and/or collaborative projects would require to be shared using a remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Similar to auto-commit, a periodic pull into the same branch that I am working on locally
could result in unexpected code modifications leading to errors/bugs/mis-functionality
