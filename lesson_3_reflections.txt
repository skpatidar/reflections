When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Open source and/or collaborative projects would require to be shared using a remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Similar to auto-commit, a periodic pull into the same branch that I am working on locally
could result in unexpected code modifications leading to errors/bugs/mis-functionality

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

Forks are useful to 'clone' something within GitHub. Clones are required to sync b/w Github 
and local setup, while may also be required to clone within the local setup. Branching is 
used when you want to make any experimental or significant changes withing the repo, but 
do not want to start altering the master branch just yet.
